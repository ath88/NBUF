# *nbuf* Library Project Page

The thesis document can be found [here](https://github.com/ath88/nbuf-thesis/raw/master/thesis.pdf).


In `src` is located `nbuf.hpp` and `nbuf.cpp`. This is the library, and can be included into your project.

In `src` there are two example implementations, called `minmaxavgdisk.cpp` and `minmaxavgmemory.cpp`. These are both using the library.
